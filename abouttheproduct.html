  <h2> About the Product</h2>
  <p class= "abouttheproduct">
    <p><h2>Traffic lights have many benefits to it. They can save many lives by just installing more of it in this world. In my opinion, there aren't enough. Especially where I live, Belize. Although Belize is a small country, there are still many people here with homes and children. I feel like traffic lights are undervalued because people don't realize how much they protect people while on the road. Some people find them highly annoying because they hold you back or make you wait a long time but without them, the road would be a disaster. Accidents happen everyday and no one can fix it, but traffic lights can improve it. They help traffic run smoothly with no collision, they reduce the number of accidents on a daily basis, and they even help the traffic police so when it rains, they don't have to stand there and conduct. Traffic lights are so beneficial from just directing cars to saving someone's life.<h2></p>

<h2> Social Problem</h2>
<p class= "socialproblem"
<p><h2>There are many social problems in the world where people’s lives are in danger or the earth, on a whole, is harmed. Car accidents happen everyday in the world and I believe we can prevent it. Although it won’t permanently stop it, there will defintely be a decrease. It has come to the point where people are even scared to drive by themselves due to the amount of things that happen everyday. Not knowing if you will get home safe or injured is scary but people can feel a sense of relief by having a set of “rules” while on the road.<h2></p>
