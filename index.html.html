<h1> How Traffic Lights Can Benefit Our Earth  </h1>
<!-- Paragraph 1-->
<p class="two"><h2> Traffic Lights are a source of safety when driving. They ensure no cars end up in accidents and make sure people get to their destination safely. Without traffic lights on a busy road, accidents are bound to happen, leaving people severly injured or even lifeless. By installing more traffic lights, there would be a decrease in accidents and in general, make people feel safer when driving. Experienced coders can improve the daily lives of people when they drive. Coding can make a diffrence in the world and thatâ€™s why I think teaching young people about this program is important. We can solve this world problem and with more and more experinced coders, it will get better.<h2> </p>
