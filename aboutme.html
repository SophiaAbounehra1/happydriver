<h1> Learn About Me:)<h1>

<!-- Paragraph 1-->
<p><h2>Greetings, my name is Sophia Aboou-Nehra, creator of this website. :)
I am a 14 year old girl who lives in Belize and attends Saint Catherine's Academy.
To me, traffic lights are a very important source for our world. I believe driving safely is a necessity.
I wouldn't want anyone to go through the very tramatic incident which affected me along with my whole family.
About a few years ago, I had lost a family member due to a collision between a four-way street that had no traffic lights, just stop signs.
It was heart-breaking to all  of us and ever since then, we have made sure driving is to be done safely.
Although this accident was devastating, it has made me very passionate about safety precautions.
I hope my presentation has inspired people to just keep an extra eye out and stay safe.</h2></p>
